# Human Activity Recognition with Attention-based Neural Network

## Data  
PAMAP2 Dataset: [http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/pamap2+physical+activity+monitoring](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/pamap2+physical+activity+monitoring)

## Code Structure
legacy: old script to train with TensorFlow on WISDM dataset

layers: attention layers in Keras

data: script to preprocess PAMAP2 dataset

keras_model_factory.py: contains functions to build multiple models used for training

keras_pamap2_train.py: script to train models with Keras

## Results
